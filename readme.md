Pronouns.js is my anal retentive addition to generate properly formatted pronouns leveraging Alejo's [Data](https://github.com/Alejo47) library.
I also use [streamerbot's](https://streamerbot.github.io/client/) pronoun data to save redundant work on "simple" pronouns
PR's are welcome. I'm not a web dev, so I'm not bothering with better packaging.
